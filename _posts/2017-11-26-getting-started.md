## Overview

[Solar Tirol](http://webgis.eurac.edu/solartirol/)

## Method

The approach incorporates the workflow for convenient and successful analysis of large amounts of spatial data, includes an integration of different formats as vector and raster and allows query operations and spatial analysis. The initial data, the DTM and DSM, are derived from the LIDAR data and provided as input information for solar radiation simulations.

The main data sources are ambient temperature grid, cadaster data and vector data of protected areas. The estimations of photovoltaic characteristics are based on the complex algorithm and allow to work with different PV technologies. The average temperature is calculated according to [Huld et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815205001593) (2006). In order to estimate it, regression analysis is produced on a series of temperature datasets based on curve fit of 3rd order polynomial.

Therefore, the contribution of the research includes an integration of the methodology for the solar potential estimations for complex Alpine landscapes into the Web environment. Besides, the application examines the capacity of raster analysis on big data. Moreover, the Solar WebGIS has been developed within an existing SDI that provides easy access for collaboration and distribution of solar potential data.
